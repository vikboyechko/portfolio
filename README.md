# Portfolio Project

This project combined two weeks of diving deep into HTML and CSS.

What seemed simple at first turned into quite a complex webpage that uses responsive design, flex box, and grid, plus wireframing the plan of attack.

## Challenges

One of the hardest parts was figuring out all the flex box and grid properties and values for three different layouts.

Another challenge was figuring out how to add a color overlay to images. It works with images loaded in the CSS using the background property, but I chose to load images in the HTML. What ended up working was using the CSS filter property to adjust brightness, hue rotation, and saturation, but it still doesn't look quite the same as a color overlay.

Finally, at first this website worked great in Firefox, which is what I used for development, but it was not rendering correctly in Chrome or Safari. I went back in and adjusted much of the CSS while keeping an eye on multiple browsers.
